Project Start:Spring 2021

Objective: Determine the probability of occupancy within tree cavitis and how this is influenced by habitat characteristics

Data used:
1. Occupancy monitoring data of 156 tree cavities
2. Habitat data for each cavity tree (includes cavity height, width, DBH, tree species, etc.)

Files within "Occupancy Monitoring" folder:

"Data"
Includes all data collected in the field and uploaded from Jotform (online data collection app).
Subfolders within this folder includes:
	1. Raw Data - raw occupancy and habitat data sheets READ ONLY
	2. Processed Data - Occupany data that was reformatted and cleaned and a merged data sheet with both occupancy and habitat data
	3. Excel Sheets - previously used excel tables for conducting random selection of tree cavities to be monitored, list of current cavities being monitored, 
		data sheet with all cavities from 2018-2022.
	4. Analysis - this subfolder will contain all outputs from data analysis

"Figures"
Includes any figures or images that result from data analysis and visualization

"Google Earth"
Includes location data of each tree cavity that is monitored for occupancy and save Google Earth projects

"R Code"
All code saved from Rstudio
